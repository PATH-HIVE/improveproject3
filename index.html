    <p> <strong>Projects</strong>:
      They all start with the seed of an idea. 
      We ask ourselves: “I have a project, I have an initiative, I have a dream: what questions shall I ask to get the ball rolling?”
      Research tells us that the success rate of transformation and change initiatives is less than 30% within organisations.</p>
    
      <p>Two questions:
        1.	Can it go up to 100% 
        2.	Might a well designed software platform, created with massive input from in house talent among all stakeholders, be a step in the right direction? 
        Our goal is to build momentum to take the success rate from 30% to 100%. 
        This is our dream.
        </p>
    <p>The inspiration to build a software tool came from a workshop where one of the attendees, a business owner managing several enterprises, shared his experience. He described meetings with his 20-member team where they would enthusiastically brainstorm new ideas or explore ways to improve existing processes. Despite the detailed discussions, they often struggled to determine the next actionable steps.</p>
    <p>The tool takes us from the first step (the dream) to then discussing key elements of the new project – the questions we need to ask and work collaboratively to find the answers.</p>
    <p> <strong> <em> “Would such a simple tool be of value to you?”
      A lot of projects fail, not for technical reasons but because of a rush to plan and insufficient consideration of success criteria.
      What do you think?</em> </strong></p>
