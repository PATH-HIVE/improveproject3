## What I would like to achieve
I aim to build a tool that helps corporate clients avoid rushing through the planning and implementation phases of strategic initiatives. 

The tool will encourage spending adequate time addressing fundamental questions, involving all relevant stakeholders to secure their buy-in, and identifying potential issues early on to prevent blocking surprises later. 



*<span style="color: blue;">[Back to Content](#content)</span>*
## Why

By ensuring a thorough due diligence process, the tool will minimize future surprises, reduce resources needed to fix errors, and significantly increase the chances of initiatives achieving their objectives and delivering desired benefits.

*<span style="color: blue;">[Back to Content](#content)</span>*
## Target Audiance

My primary target audience is corporate clients, as the tool is designed to support their strategic initiatives effectively.

However, it is adaptable and can also benefit small start-up teams or even individuals with a dream they want to turn into reality. 

By guiding users through a structured process, stakeholder engagement, and due diligence, the tool helps ensure that initiatives, regardless of scale, have a solid foundation for success.

*<span style="color: blue;">[Back to Content](#content)</span>*
## Success Criteria

1. Human and Emotional Impact:

The most important measure is how users feel when using the tool. I want every user to feel competent and confident in handling uncertainty and never overwhelmed or intimidated by new ideas or initiatives. This tool is designed to empower them, providing a simple yet structured approach to starting initiatives on the right path and maintaining confidence throughout the process.

2. Improved Success Rates:

The tool aims to significantly increase the success rate of project management, business change, and transformation initiatives, as well as start-up ideas. By focusing on thorough planning and stakeholder engagement, the tool will help reduce errors and ensure a smoother path to achieving objectives.

3.  Commercial Adoption and Engagement:

On the commercial side, success will involve engaging 10,000 clients to adopt and benefit from the tool. From there, I plan to explore pricing strategies, offering options such as one-off purchases or monthly subscriptions, ensuring the tool's accessibility and value for a wide range of users.

## Git Used
1. Clone project3 from github to my local machine

       git clone https://github.com/PATH-HIVE/project3.git

2. Rename my folder in my local machine from project3 to improveproject3

3. Create a new repository in Github with the name improveproject3

4. Initiate a new local git repository 
 
        git init

5. Link to the remote repository in Github

       git remote add origin https://github.com/PATH-HIVE/improveproject3.git

6. Rename the default branch to main.

       git branch -M main

7. Verify the remote is set correctly

       git remote set-url origin https://github.com/PATH-HIVE/improveproject3.git

9. Checks the status of the working directory and ensures everything is ready to be pushed.

       git status

10. Push local changes to the remote and set upstream. In this case pushes the whole code to the github repository as it was empty

        git push -u origin main 

11.  Create a new branch in github from the command line

         git branch ab-improveproject3-branch1

18. Commit the changes

        git commit -m "Update readme"

19. Push changes to the branch

        git push origin ab-improveproject3-branch1
