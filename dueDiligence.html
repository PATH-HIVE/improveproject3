        <p> <strong>Projects</strong>:
          They all start with the seed of an idea.
          We ask ourselves: “I have a project, I have an initiative, I have a dream: what questions shall I ask to get the
          ball rolling?”
          Research tells us that the success rate of transformation and change initiatives is less than 30% within
          organisations.</p>
    
        <p>Two questions:
          1. Can it go up to 100%
          2. Might a well designed software platform, created with massive input from in house talent among all
          stakeholders, be a step in the right direction?
          Our goal is to build momentum to take the success rate from 30% to 100%.
          This is our dream.
